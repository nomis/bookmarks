# Bookmarks Website

Created to learn Ruby on Rails and host my own del.icio.us alternative.

## Requirements

* Bookmarks must have a title and a URI
* Bookmarks may be tagged
	* Tags are separated by spaces
	* Tags cannot contain spaces
	* All tags share the same
* Incremental searching by filtering on tags
	* Provide a list of all possible tags
	* Clicking on a tag adds or removes it from the filter
* Bookmarks are intended to be publicly visible
* Read-only unless logged in
* Single user so no self-registration
* No cookies, except on **successful** login
* All functionality must work without JavaScript
